# referring_url_token
Small module to get the referring URL and create a token that can be used in drupal

Upload and enable the module. Once enabled, you should be able to use the tokens [server:HTTP_REFERER] and [server:HTTP_USER_AGENT] 

This is literally straight from the issue queue on d.o (https://www.drupal.org/node/2021969), I just took the info and applied it in a module.
